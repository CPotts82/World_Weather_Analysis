# World_Weather_Analysis
## Purpose/Overview
The objective of this project was to create an App to help users plan vacations based on preferred weather.  This app uses API calls from OpenWeatherMap to generate current weather conditions on various cities around the globe.  The app allows users to input their desired maximum and minimum temperatures to experience while on vacation.  Using this information, the app returns various cities that meet users specifications.  At this point the user can choose a city or multiple ciites to travel to.  Along with allowing the user to keep up with current weather conditions, the app also plans the travel route and suggests destination hotels.   Using API calls from Google Maps, once the user chooses where to go, the app returns hotels and directional travel maps for the upcoming vacation.
